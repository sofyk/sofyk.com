An interactive fiction game that lets you stroll through the conversation a couple is having at a restaurant. Play it <a href="https://sofyk.itch.io/lunch/">HERE</a>!

Lunch is a game about a couple that is having an argument that is entirely unrelated to the actual issues troubling the relationship. It is about two people reading into things, yet never stating their mind. At least not during that lunch. It will be up to the player to figure out what actually troubles the relationship.
