I got an awesome tutorial book [Unity 3.x Game Development Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/Unity-3-x-Game-Development-Essentials/dp/1849691444/) by Will Goldstone. And Survival Island is the result. All of the models, textures, and sounds came with the book, and all I had to do is code. It was really fun! And I feel like I learned a bunch. But most importantly, it gave me focus and direction. It was a good size first project to give me confidence, and fill me with drive and curiosity for more.

I plan to work on it some more. Fix some bugs, and add some more features. So stay tuned!
