      <p><p><em>Horror/suspense: The climax occurs at a cottage where a character seeks refuge. An old superstition is uncovered and put to the test. An investigative journalist . The lights begin to flicker.</em></p>

<p>This was a terrible idea. Robert knew that long before he found himself in the attic of this abandoned cottage. Yet following terrible ideas to terrible places has been part of Robert’s job description as a journalist for quite a while now. He always felt that the purity of his pursuit for uncovering and shedding light on the truth has attracted the attention of a great unexplainable force; always protecting and guiding him. But tonight he feared that even that force did not dare to enter this place with him.</p>

<p>They both showed up to cheer-up Robbie after a rough breakup. Even though they were best friends with Robbie for years now, they’ve never met. Robbie was convinced that the universe would implode if they ever do. They’ve heard stories of each other though. Many stories.

<p>Zorn was petting a red scaled beast resting on his lap. I could almost swear he was purring. The dragon, that is. A second dragon was curled up next to his feet. This might have seemed charming if the two pets were not fire breathing devils, owned by an antisocial magus who was only ever seen in public twice. Both times are generally regarded as not the most pleasant visits. Although that was before the new party arrived. The definition of pleasant has since shifted. Not for the better, might I add.</p>

      <p><p>Since she could remember herself, her father prepared her for moments like this. Don&#39;t talk to strangers. Don&#39;t open the door to strangers. Now, there were two shadows reflecting on the living room window.</p>

<p>“Where&#39;s the money, Jack?” the larger shadow demanded. After a moment of silence, she heard the window break, as a man&#39;s body flew through it crashing into her home. The man grunted. She heard glass shuttering under the boots of the large stranger entering her home. If a stranger opens the door forcefully, get under the bed and stay quite until the danger is gone. The monster hunted darkness under her bed seemed comforting, now that the stranger came.</p>

<p>“I don&#39;t owe you nothing, you little piece of shi - Ah!” she heard the stranger&#39;s foot run into the man&#39;s guts.</p>

<p>“Wrong answer.”</p>

      <p><p>Finally, the last box of Daniel&#39;s belongings was now sitting comfortably in the middle of his new living room. And even though it was surrounded by many similar boxes, the room still seemed vast and open. Daniel tore off the plastic from his old armchair and plopped in it. It was the most comfortable piece of furniture he ever owned, and in it he was finally able to relax from the tedious move. Daniel hated moving. He spent weeks packing all his things, just so that he can spend more time unpacking. The whole process seemed so redundant to him.</p>

      <p><p>This is a work of fiction, any similarity or likeness to any events or persons living or dead is purely coincidental.</p>

<p>Daly City, 2 Shoal Dr - 3:00am</p>

<p>A phone ring attempted to pull Janet away from her dreams. She was dissatisfied with that fact, as she was having a delightful dream. Janet M. Rouge was just about to outsmart the pompous, intolerable, and arrogant Alexander Darren Keen, also known as “Ass Holmes” among the local police force. Mr. Keen was about to be humiliated in front of the Chief of Police and whole of San Francisco&#39;s news broadcasts, if not for the second phone ring that finally woke Janet up.</p>

<p>“Janet speaking,” she said in a half dreaming voice, but her expression quickly acquired alertness, and she jumped out of bed.</p>

<p>“I&#39;ll be right over.”</p>
