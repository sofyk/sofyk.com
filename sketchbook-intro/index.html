    <p>Published: Jul 12, 2015 by Sofy Kabachek</p>

    <p>My friend and I talked about the habit of writing. How hard it can sometimes be to keep writing my project. Even when I know exactly what needs to happen on that page, the words escape. Yet the invariable you’ll hear from any writer is that you must always write. It must become a habit. But how?</p>

<p>That is when the idea of a Warm-up Sketchbook surfaced up. Back in art school, my friend was instructed to have a completely separate sketchbook just for warm-ups. before each class the artist stretch their muscles with simple, almost throw away, doodles. In the case of my friend, they were circles. Three days a week, for eighteen weeks, the first ten minutes of the class were circles. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>My friend now draws a perfect circle. I know there’s a bunch of mathematicians in the back raising a sceptical brow, but you haven’t seen her circle.</p>

<p>That is what we needed. We then focused on translating that practice to writing. On a regular basis, especially when no other writing was done, I want to spend some time putting words on a (metaphorical) page. Doesn’t have to end-up as anything, doesn’t have to be any good. It just has to be.</p>

<p>We found a prompt app to help with the empty page affliction, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev17163.app225586&amp;hl=en">Story Plot Generator</a>. And every day I’ll try to write down more than 300 words, inspired by the generated plot. The results will be posted on this site for your pleasure. Enjoy!</p>
