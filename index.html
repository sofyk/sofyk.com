<p>The local town has been hit with a strange affliction. people fall into a deep sleep. not really a comma, because they keep chanting in strange language in their sleep. the whole town has been quarantined. and a special high level quarantine area was established for the patient. only relief and rescue professionals, and parents of minors within the quarantine were allowed to enter the town. after some legal fights, and a court ruling, a handful of journalists were allowed to enter as well. Robert was one of them.
No one is allowed to leave.all the patients were afflicted simultaneously after a short power fluctuation in the town. both the CDC and the John Hopkins department of infectious disease cannot identify the pattern of infection.
Robert found that all patients have had personal items stolen. Not all were of significant monetary value, but they all were of great personal importance.
Following the train of thefts leads him to the cottage. There in the attic he finds the thief afflicted by the sleep, drooling and mumbling. He was passed out in the middle of a strange design drawn with chalk, surrounded with the stolen items. on a podium next to him was an old book.
Robert photographs the scene. Trying to capture every detail. And leaves the place as fast as possible. something about quiets even his curiosity. He sends the pictures to a friend of his, a theology professor at Princeton, in hopes that he might know someone that could shed light on this strange scene.</p>

<p>But this was an emergency. Robbie was on the verge of buying a ticket to Tonga. He aimed to follow his now-ex girlfriend who was recently engaged to a local rugby player. Robbie was convinced that if only they could see each other again, their love would reignite into a fiery sun, and all will be well. Sarah and Eric knew better. They arrived at the scene just in time to stop Robbie from confirming his flight order.
Of course Robbie would claim that he was nowhere near confirming the flight, simply entertaining an idea. And that slamming his laptop shut and throwing it across the room may have been an over reaction. But, as was mentioned before, Sarah and Eric knew better.
“Eric, meet Sarah. Sarah, that’s Eric.” Robbie said with slight hesitation. He would be a little more concerned about his laptop, if his world was not in the process of imploding.
“Pleasure.” Sarah smiled, as was proper, and gave Eric a sturdy handshake.
“We’ll see about that.”
Whenever one has to make difficult and complex decisions with a wide array of consequences, it is highly recommended to have two great friends that will invariably take the opposite side and present thorough justification that theirs is the preferable choice. It’s not entirely as simple as a devil and angel on one’s shoulder; morality is such a vague concept in daily life decisions. But more like the good side of two oppositely charged coins. Now they were shaking hands. And on this historic occasion, Eric and Sarah agreed; Robbie should not be going to Tonga.</p>

<p>He lifted his finger to signal me to come closer. Hesitantly I made my way to the steel chair at the head of the table.
“Well.”
It wasn’t a question. In fact I wasn’t sure what that was supposed to mean. Probably that I should leave.
“well…” I hesitated. “Look, I know you don’t care. And that’s fine. It’s been fine for years now. We don’t really want that to change. I can’t even imagine what it would be like if you actually cared. Oh gods, that would be a complete disaster-”
“Get to the point.”
“Right...I…”
“NOW!” The two dragons lifted their heads, the purring stopped, and they slowly shifted their focus to me.
“We need you, Zorn. You’re the only one who can get a hold of the capitals.”
“That is inaccurate.”
“But it is! Everyone else has been taken, or worse, converted by the party. Gosh darn it, if I had the spells I’d do myself...”
“You can have the spells.”
“You would do that?”
“I don’t want any part in this. I don’t care for your silly politics.”
“This has gone far beyond politics. There is something very wrong going on here. I mean, they closed ‘Pots and Bat Wings’ and no one can figure out where Ruth disappeared to. And the pub around the corner, you know the one, lava something…”
“Lava Pit.”
“Right! They found out that a bunch of us were getting together there...and...and...Zorn, we’re desperate.”
“You had your secret political movement in the Lava Pit?! It was the only place clear of all that filth, and you brought it there?!”
“We didn&#39;t have secret meetings! It was the only place where we could have a drink without getting snitched on by some party youth. And now it’s gone.”
“You should not have brought this to the Lava Pit. You right wing scum!”
“So you’re not gonna help us.”
Zorn lowered his gaze, and returned to petting the dragon in his lap. He seemed to have disappeared again into his own world, like he always does. This was a long shot anyway. They all told me so. I guess I’m just too naive. I mean what do you expect from a loner who spends most of his time with fire breathing reptiles. With a sigh I turned to walk away.
“Is Saffron all right?” A low tone torn from a distant place.
“We...we don’t know. We can’t find her either.” My voice broke. “And she had nothing to do with any of it...”
“I will help you find her.”</p>

      <p><p>My friend and I talked about the habit of writing. How hard it can sometimes be to keep writing my project. Even when I know exactly what needs to happen on that page, the words escape. Yet the invariable you&#39;ll hear from any writer is that you must always write. It must become a habit. But how?</p>

      <p>Some times after a long day of staring at your work without any progress, the only logical thing to do is - go crazy. I wish people didn't stare every time that happened. It's not like it happens too often. Don't judge me.

      <p><p>Since she could remember herself, her father prepared her for moments like this. Don&#39;t talk to strangers. Don&#39;t open the door to strangers. Now, there were two shadows reflecting on the living room window.</p>

<p>“Where&#39;s the money, Jack?” the larger shadow demanded. After a moment of silence, she heard the window break, as a man&#39;s body flew through it crashing into her home. The man grunted. She heard glass shuttering under the boots of the large stranger entering her home. If a stranger opens the door forcefully, get under the bed and stay quite until the danger is gone. The monster hunted darkness under her bed seemed comforting, now that the stranger came.</p>

<p>“I don&#39;t owe you nothing, you little piece of shi - Ah!” she heard the stranger&#39;s foot run into the man&#39;s guts.</p>

<p>“Wrong answer.”</p>

      <p><p>Finally, the last box of Daniel&#39;s belongings was now sitting comfortably in the middle of his new living room. And even though it was surrounded by many similar boxes, the room still seemed vast and open. Daniel tore off the plastic from his old armchair and plopped in it. It was the most comfortable piece of furniture he ever owned, and in it he was finally able to relax from the tedious move. Daniel hated moving. He spent weeks packing all his things, just so that he can spend more time unpacking. The whole process seemed so redundant to him.</p>

<p>Daly City, 2 Shoal Dr - 3:00am</p>

<p>A phone ring attempted to pull Janet away from her dreams. She was dissatisfied with that fact, as she was having a delightful dream. Janet M. Rouge was just about to outsmart the pompous, intolerable, and arrogant Alexander Darren Keen, also known as “Ass Holmes” among the local police force. Mr. Keen was about to be humiliated in front of the Chief of Police and whole of San Francisco&#39;s news broadcasts, if not for the second phone ring that finally woke Janet up.</p>

<p>“Janet speaking,” she said in a half dreaming voice, but her expression quickly acquired alertness, and she jumped out of bed.</p>

<p>“I&#39;ll be right over.”</p>
